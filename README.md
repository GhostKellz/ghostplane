## 🚀 What is Ghostplane?

**Ghostplane** is the modular Layer 2 execution engine for Ghostchain — designed for ultra-fast, zero-trust smart contract execution and scalable token settlement **over QUIC, HTTP/3, and IPv6** infrastructure.

Built entirely in **Zig**, Ghostplane interfaces directly with:

* [`zvm`](https://github.com/ghostkellz/zvm) — the WebAssembly VM in Zig
* [`ghostcipher`](https://github.com/ghostkellz/ghostcipher) — for signature and crypto validation
* [`ghostwire`](https://github.com/ghostkellz/ghostwire) — for public network transport over modern protocols
* [`ghostbridge`](https://github.com/ghostkellz/ghostbridge) — bridges to Rust-based L1 Ghostchain if needed

Ghostplane runs **stateless**, low-cost, high-throughput execution powered by **GCC (Ghostchain Credits)** or optionally **ZMAN (Zero-trust Mana)** for covenant-gated validation.

## 🧱 Core Architecture

| Layer     | Module                                     | Description                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Execution | [`zvm`](https://github.com/ghostkellz/zvm) | WASM-based smart contract runtime        |
| Transport | `ghostwire`                                | QUIC/HTTP3 networking stack              |
| Identity  | `sigil`, `guardian`                        | DID-based auth + signature enforcement   |
| Crypto    | `ghostcipher`                              | zcrypto + zsig                           |
| Bridge    | `ghostbridge`                              | FFI or gRPC into L1 Ghostchain if needed |

## 🧪 Key Features

* ⚡ **Fast execution** — native Zig runtime and zero FFI overhead
* 🌐 **Internet-native** — deploy contracts over IPv6, QUIC, and HTTP/3
* 🔐 **Zero-trust security model** — contracts gated by identity, auth policy
* ↻ **L1 optionality** — can run standalone or interop with Rust-based Ghostchain L1
* 🔀 **ZNS & GID-native** — works with `sigil` and `zns` for decentralized resolution
* 📦 **Modular** — fully composable components for Web5-style stack

## 💰 Token Economics

Ghostplane can be powered by:

| Token              | Symbol | Purpose                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ghostchain Credits | `GCC`  | Default gas unit for L2 execution                          |
| Zero-trust Mana    | `ZMAN` | Optional proof-of-identity power source tied to `guardian` |
| Spirit (optional)  | `SPRT` | Governance or DAO participation layer                      |

> **Note:** You can define your own token model within Ghostplane using `keystone` and `covenant`.

## 📡 Network Design

Ghostplane is designed to operate over **public internet protocols**:

* QUIC (RFC 9000)
* HTTP/3
* Native IPv6 tunneling
* gRPC bridges into traditional systems via `ghostbridge`

It supports **ZNS resolution**, allowing `.ghost`, `.sig`, `.gcc`, or `.bc` domains to resolve to smart contract endpoints or wallet identifiers.

---

## 🔧 Usage & Integration

Ghostplane can be used as:

1. A standalone execution platform for Zig-native dApps
2. A Layer 2 execution engine over Ghostchain L1 (Rust)
3. A decentralized, zero-trust gateway over existing public networks

Example use cases:

* Stateless contract verification
* Off-chain proof validation
* On-demand identity + signature challenges
* High-speed oracles and DNS resolution layers
