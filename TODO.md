# ✈️ GHOSTPLANE TODO

> A modular Zig-based Layer 2 execution engine for Ghostchain

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a **zero-trust, high-performance L2 execution layer** in Zig
- Offload transaction validation, zk/pre-compiled logic, and micro-transfers
- Bridge securely with the Ghostchain (Rust L1) via `ghostbridge` (FFI/gRPC)
- Use `zvm` for deterministic WASM smart contract execution
- Integrate cryptographic/auth stack from `shroud`

---

## 📦 Dependencies

- [ ] ✅ `shroud` (ghostcipher, sigil, keystone, covenant, etc.)
- [ ] ✅ `zvm` – WASM smart contract runtime
- [ ] ✅ `tokioZ` – Zig-native async runtime
- [ ] ✅ `ghostbridge` – Rust <-> Zig bindings (for Ghostchain interface)
- [ ] (Optional) zk-proof crate or plugin (TBD)

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Tasks

### Core Setup

- [ ] Set up new Zig repo/project: `ghostplane`
- [ ] Add `build.zig.zon` dependencies for:
  - shroud
  - tokioZ
  - zvm
  - ghostbridge (via shared interface .zig/.h bindings)

### Protocol Design

- [ ] Define Ghostplane's role in the architecture:
  - [ ] Executor for `ZMAN` (mana) and `GCC`-based microtransactions
  - [ ] Secure L2-to-L1 commit interface
  - [ ] Identity enforcement via `sigil`/`guardian`
  - [ ] State handling via `keystone`

- [ ] Draft data structures:
  - [ ] Transaction
  - [ ] Off-chain batch
  - [ ] Proof commit format
  - [ ] Identity scope + policy context

### Network + Bridge

- [ ] Add QUIC + HTTP3 interfaces via `ghostwire`
- [ ] Add FFI interfaces for Ghostchain callbacks
- [ ] Add gRPC handlers via ghostbridge

### Execution + Runtime

- [ ] Plug in `zvm` as WASM runtime
- [ ] Add contract ABI + loader
- [ ] Integrate `covenant` rules engine for policy enforcement
- [ ] Gas or metering system (for ZMAN or GCC)

### Auth + Access

- [ ] Integrate `sigil` for GID handling and authZ context
- [ ] Integrate `guardian` for multi-sig + policy gates

---

## 🧪 Testing

- [ ] Build test harness for L2 block batches
- [ ] Simulate bridge commits to Ghostchain L1
- [ ] Validate identity + access rules
- [ ] Benchmark async throughput with tokioZ

---

## 📝 Docs

- [ ] Write README.md with architecture overview
- [ ] Create `ghostplane.proto` if applicable for gRPC APIs
- [ ] Document integration flows (ghostchain ↔ ghostplane)

---

## 🧩 Future

- [ ] zk-STARK/ZK-Rollup support module
- [ ] Verifiable delay functions (VDFs)
- [ ] Native mobile/light client support
- [ ] L3 rollups?

---

## Potential Depedencies 
- [ ] ghostchain (Rust L1) - https://github.com/ghostkellz/ghostchain
- [ ] tokioZ (zig async runtime ) - https://github.com/ghostkellz/tokioZ 
- [ ] Shroud (crypto and auth stack - Sigil for ID (like old realid) Keystone for state covenant for rules etc - https://github.com/ghostkellz/shroud
- [ ] zvm (zig wasm runtime) - https://github.com/ghostkellz/zvm
- [ ] zns (Zig Name Service (ENS + unstoppable domains resolver in future with integrated resolver) - https://github.com/ghostkellz/zns
- [ ] Wraith - HTTP3/QUIC based reverse proxy and load balancer written in zig - blockchain user Web3 landing pages etc - https://github.com/ghostkellz/wraith

> Ghostplane is the execution engine for decentralized, zero-trust L2 scale.
